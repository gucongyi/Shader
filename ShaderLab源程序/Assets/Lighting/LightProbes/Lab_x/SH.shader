//This is the spherical harmonic lookup, it takes in the world normal and spits out the appropriate value in that direction
 //It comes from appendix 10 of Peter Pike Sloan's paper "Stupid Spherical Harmonic Tricks"
 //It's a bit more complex than the simpliest transform so it can be more efficient
 //http://www.ppsloan.org/publications/StupidSH36.pdf

 //It takes 12 coefficients (the numbers in the _SHA,_SHB and _SHC vectors) multiplies them against eachother to construct the harmonic
 //Each coefficient represents a cosine wave (which in turn are used to describe the sphere, axis by axis)
 //Each level _SHA - _SHB etc divides the sphere into two sub spheres, and each contains more detail (higher frequency data) about the final wave/sphere 

//It can be thought of as sound
 //Each seperate frequency is a different pitch, and the final sound is all these pieces blended together
